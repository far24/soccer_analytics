The aim of this blogpost is to document all the tools and resources that are necessary to start soccer analytics.  I will point out here that [Mr. Maias Mascioto's github page](https://github.com/matiasmascioto/awesome-soccer-analytics) has a more comprehensive collection of very very useful resources for data analytics.  My intention is to add resource items as I learn and use them in my analysis.  I am starting to explore the soccer analytics following the ["Friends of Tracking"](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUBFJYcag8j2rm_9HkrrA7w) youtube channel.  The support system for my analytics work are categorized into three (3) parts: *Tools*, *Data Resources*, and *Knowledge Resources*, and lastly *People to follow*.  I will be adding more links and resouces to this blogpost as I spend more time into my exploration. Now, following paragraphs will lists the items in each category:
